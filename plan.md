- Length: Scannable in 30 seconds, deep enough for 3-minute read

### Content Strategy
- Lead with strongest work (thread safety PR = reliability at scale)
- Connect dots: Security SDK → MCP servers → AI agent workflows
- Show trajectory: Traditional dev → AI/blockchain frontier
- Prove depth: Specific technical details, not buzzwords
